Fun fact: I like dinosaurs.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


 Lab 9, Part 2
This was one of my favorite labs because I enjoy making games and that
is what we did.  Making a secret number in our code and using it in
a game was really interesting.  Writing the code was challenging, 
but worth it to be able to play a game knowing me and my partners made it.


 Lab 8, Part 1
This was also one of my favorite labs because it was nice to see that you
can make scores for any type of event you wanted.
I thought this would be fun for me to understand if I wanted to do it on 
my own.  I believe it would be fun if I used it in other circumstances 
like other events or games if I wanted to.
